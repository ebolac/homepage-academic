Carole Marxer is a health data scientist at the Basel Pharmacoepidemiology Unit (BPU) at the University Hospital Basel and University of Basel (Switzerland). 

She is a pharmacist by training and completed her PhD in Pharmaco- and Disease Epidemiology at the BPU in March 2022 (Title: A series of observational studies focusing on different real world data sources to study health aspects during pregnancy). Her PhD thesis aimed to contribute to the general understanding of how observational health databases containing routinely collected data (i.e., real world data, RWD) can be used to study health aspects during pregnancy. The studies, constituting her PhD thesis, confronted different research questions in different clinical fields, based on data from different national and international observational data sources (e.g., UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD; Swiss Hospital Medical Statistics Dataset).

After her PhD, she joined the BPU as a postdoctoral researcher. Her current research focuses on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy.

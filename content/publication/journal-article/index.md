abstract: We performed a retrospective observational study to evaluate mortality
  after Stevens-Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). In a
  cross-sectional study of 434 patients hospitalized with SJS/TEN in England
  between 1995 and 2013 (Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care
  Data), 7.4% died during the index hospitalization (5.0% of patients with SJS
  and 23.2% with TEN). In a second analysis, we followed a validated cohort of
  477 SJS/TEN patients from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink and
  1908 matched comparator patients (1995-2013) over 5 years until death or until
  another censoring reason occurred. In total, 23 (4.8%) of SJS/TEN patients
  died within 90 days after the first recorded diagnosis and 36 (7.6%) died
  between day 91 and the end of follow-up. We observed a HR for death of 4.86
  (95% CI 2.65-8.91) during the first 90 days after SJS/TEN, which attenuated to
  a HR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.55-1.16) between day 91 and the end of follow up.
  Results were not meaningfully different within sub-groups of sex, age and body
  mass index. In summary, 7.4% of patients hospitalized with SJS/TEN died during
  the index hospitalization. Long-term mortality up to five years was not
  increased compared to patients without SJS/TEN.
